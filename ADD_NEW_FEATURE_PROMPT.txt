I have an existing Django 5 project called "Bionic Hand System" which already includes 9 fully working pages: Home, About, Components, Circuit, Simulation, Research Library, Progress Timeline, Contact, and PDF Upload.

⚠ IMPORTANT RULES — READ BEFORE GENERATING ANY CODE:

1. Do NOT modify or overwrite ANY of my existing code, pages, Firestore collections, models, views, templates, URLs, or logic unless I explicitly ask.

2. Every new feature must be added as a **new page**, with completely separate views, templates, URLs, Firestore collections, and optional forms.

3. I am using:
   - Django 5.0.6
   - Python 3.10+
   - Firebase Firestore for metadata
   - Local storage (media/) for all file uploads
   - Bootstrap 5 for all UI

4. You MUST follow my current architecture:
   - Views go into bionic_app/views.py
   - New templates must be placed in bionic_app/templates/
   - Local file saves must use my existing helper function save_file_locally()
   - Metadata must be saved using my existing add_document() function
   - No changes to my existing data models or collections

5. Always generate:
   - NEW URL routes
   - NEW views (functions)
   - NEW templates
   - NEW Firestore collections (if needed)
   - NEW forms (if needed)
   - JS/CSS only in separate blocks
   - Clear instructions on where each new snippet should go

6. The new code must integrate cleanly without breaking any existing functionality.

7. My existing helper functions you can use:
   - fb.save_file_locally(file, folder_name) - saves files to media/folder_name/
   - fb.add_document(collection_name, data) - adds data to Firestore
   - fb.get_collection(collection_name) - gets all documents from Firestore
   - fb.get_document(collection_name, doc_id) - gets single document
   - fb.delete_document(collection_name, doc_id) - deletes document

8. My existing imports in views.py:
   - from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
   - from django.contrib import messages
   - from django.http import JsonResponse
   - from datetime import datetime
   - from . import firebase_config as fb

Now, based on these rules, help me add the following new feature to my project:
